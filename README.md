# HAWKS

ðŸ‘½ðŸ‘½ðŸ‘½ Greetings, human... or machine.

We are starting this discussion because we want to expand the HAWKS.
You know... I got this "feeling" that it would be awesome to spread our wings and fly even higher than ever.
With the right kind of people everything is possible, and we're that kind of guys who just don't give up when shit hits the fan.

Firstly, i should mention that if you tend to get scared when the real G's enter the room you are not the type of person i'm looking for.

Now, when i've broken the ice... You may ask yourself what i actually want to accomplish with this discussion?
Well, i want to build an even stronger circle of HAWKS. What we're looking for is developers that knows the code so to speak.

We need staff in crypto, penetration-testing, web, exploit, information gathering, marketing, economy, sales and even music -a band or dj who represents our movement is also welcome, i know this is the wrong place to look for artists... But anyway...

Of-course there will be more spots to fill as we grow. But for now we really need to build a stable environment for stashing our funds.

We got the skills to perform.
We need to have a stable income, that means we gotta market our services - Which would firstly be patronage, but could expand into multiple industries as we roll.

You see when we're about to do something it's all in or nothing.

We are tired of all the bullshit and want to build a community of like-minded people, not only developers, there could be a spot for everyone who feels just a little bit more hardcore then society.

I welcome everyone to discuss here, and we'll see if there is some kind of profit for everyone, because however you twist it - a man's gotta make his cash. That is nothing new.

If this sounds interesting at the first look and you feel like you want to discuss further in detail you are welcome to send me a pm and i'll reply with my email.

Just throwing it out there.

Best regards,
H
